# Checkers
My game is checkers. Two players locally play on a 8x8 grid. Players move thier piece diagonally and the player who runs out of pieces loses. There is a kinging implementation and players retain thier turn after taking an enemy piece. A player may also choose to surrender if they cannot move anymore.

- Player chooses what piece they want to move. That piece will have a yellow border color.

- If the player wants to reselect the piece they want to move, click the inital piece again to remove the yellow border color. Click the new piece.
- A player can only capture a piece if there is an avaialble space after the enemy piece.
- When a player's checker piece gets to the end of the board (respectively), the piece will become a king piece.
- King pieces are allowed to go backkwards as well as forward.
- Game will end when a player loses all thier pieces or a player clicks the surrender button.

# Next Steps

There are a few enhancements that can be implemented into the game:
- Create a start page and a Modal after a win.
- Add background music for throughout the game.
- Implement a drag and drop functions to allow another way to move pieces.
